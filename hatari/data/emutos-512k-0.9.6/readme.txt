EmuTOS - 512 KB version

This ROM is suitable for the following hardware:
- TT
- Falcon
- emulators of the above

Note: Extra hardware is autodetected.

This ROM is the optimal one for Hatari, with any hardware combination.

Note: There is a bug in special Hatari 1.9.0 variants which prevents IDE
working in some conditions. If you experience trouble, select 68030 CPU and
disable the "Cycle exact" option.

Some legacy programs don't work with 512k TOS images, for those one may
need to use a smaller EmuTOS image.
